# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
- This analysis seeks to observe the differences in ride fare data across different types of cities. We will specifically be looking at the relationships between Fare Totals for urban, suburban, and rural areas as well as the average fare per ride, average fare per driver, and total rides, drivers, and fares for each city type.

## Results

### Total Rides Data
- Based on the table above, we can see that most of the rides that PyBer provided occurred in urban cities, followed by suburban cities, and finally rural cities. In fact, there were about 13 times as many rides in urban cities and 5 times as many suburban rides than rural rides.

### Total Drivers Data
- Similar to the Total Rides Data, urban cities also have many times more drivers than both rural and suburban areas. However, the disparity is even greater between the different city types, with urban areas having over 100 times as many drivers as rural areas, and suburban areas having about 16 times the number of drivers.

### Total Fares Data
- Urban cities also gnerate the most revenue with the highest total fares. This is followed by suburban and finally rural areas. However, there is a much smaller disparity between the 3 city types. Urban cities only generate about 10 times as much as rural areas and suburban areas only generate about 5 times as much revenue.

### Average Fare per Ride Data
- The average fare per ride is cheaper for urban cities and more expensive for rural areas.

### Average Fare per Driver Data
- The average fare per driver is significantly less for urban areas, and the most for rural areas.

### Total Fare by City Type per Week
- When looking at the multiple-line graph, we can see roughly how much money in fares is generated each week for each city type. Based on the chart, urban areas generate the most money in fares, consistently, week over week, while rural areas generated the least.

## Summary
To address disparities among the city types, a few changes can be implemented. The most glaring is the huge disparity in the number of drivers between urban and rural areas. In order to ameliorate this, PyBer can expand there service in rural areas by hiring more drivers in those cities. Another recommendation would be to move  drivers from urban areas to rural areas since the average fare per driver is so much lower in urban areas. Finally, PyBer could even look to increase the fares in urban areas to increase profits since the average fare per ride is a little lower in these areas.
